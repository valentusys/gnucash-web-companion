# Phase 502 — PM owner-writebeta gate scope decision

Goal: Complete the phase objective from the Phase 481–530 roadmap.

Scope: Repository docs, release evidence, GitHub state, and safe verification only.

Non-goals: No private data, no original GnuCash book access, no stable/production release, and no public write-safety claim.

Acceptance criteria: The phase decision/evidence is recorded with safety boundaries intact.

Safety checks: GNUCASH_WRITES_ENABLED=false remains default; APP_ENV=test write gate is not weakened; no private books, app DBs, exports, secrets, raw paths, account names, descriptions, memos, or amounts are committed.

Verification: Git/GitHub state reviewed; public status guard and release/doc posture checked where relevant.

Expected artifacts: This handoff plus the referenced audit/release/strategy/dogfood document.

Findings:
PM decision: keep APP_ENV=test for enabled writes and require an additional non-default owner-writebeta session gate before any v0.4 release. Forbidden shortcuts: no silent writes, no default enablement, no only-copy safety, no public write beta.

Final verdict: CONTINUE
