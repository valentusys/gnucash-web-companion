# Phase 510 — Execute Cycle 3 v0.4 copied release/no-release

Goal: Complete the phase objective from the Phase 481–530 roadmap.

Scope: Repository docs, release evidence, GitHub state, and safe verification only.

Non-goals: No private data, no original GnuCash book access, no stable/production release, and no public write-safety claim.

Acceptance criteria: The phase decision/evidence is recorded with safety boundaries intact.

Safety checks: GNUCASH_WRITES_ENABLED=false remains default; APP_ENV=test write gate is not weakened; no private books, app DBs, exports, secrets, raw paths, account names, descriptions, memos, or amounts are committed.

Verification: Git/GitHub state reviewed; public status guard and release/doc posture checked where relevant.

Expected artifacts: This handoff plus the referenced audit/release/strategy/dogfood document.

Findings:
Executed PM decision: no v0.4 copied-only release, no tag, no GitHub release.

Final verdict: NO_RELEASE
