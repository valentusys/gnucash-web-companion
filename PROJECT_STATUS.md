## Repository

- GitHub: `valentusys/gnucash-web-companion`
- Local path: `/home/val/gnucash-web-companion`
- Branch: `main`
- Status: pre-alpha / MVP in progress

## Current baseline

Completed through Phase 12:

- Phase 0 — competitive review and product positioning
- Phase 1 — open-source foundation
- Phase 2 — SvelteKit + FastAPI + Docker skeleton
- Phase 3 — app metadata DB and book registry foundation
- Phase 4 — authentication foundation
- Phase 5 — read-only piecash service layer
- Phase 6 — books/accounts API and UI
- Phase 7 — transaction browsing API and UI
- Phase 8 — dashboard reports API and UI
- Phase 9 — frontend theme, mobile shell, PWA manifest
- Phase 10 — public repo hygiene and release readiness
- Phase 11 — integration QA and MVP hardening
- Phase 12 — controlled transaction writes

## Phase 13 — Agent project context

Status: complete.

Goal:

- Add root `AGENTS.md` as persistent project context for future Hermes/coding-agent sessions.
- Document architecture decisions, commands, coding rules, and security/data rules.
- Make the workflow explicit: one agent executes phases sequentially; no delegate_task by default.

GitHub tooling check:

- `git` is installed.
- `gh` is not installed on this machine, so GitHub issue automation via `gh` is blocked.
- Git push may still work through existing git credentials.

## Standing constraints

- Do not commit real financial data, GnuCash books, backups, `.env`, credentials, tokens, certificates, or private keys.
- Money values must use string/Decimal representation, not floats.
- Auth tokens must stay in httpOnly cookies, not localStorage/sessionStorage.
- App metadata stays separate from GnuCash books.
- Controlled writes require validation, access checks, backup, write lock, audit logging, and tests.
- Keep docs honest: pre-alpha, test copies first, no production guarantee.

## Standard checks

Backend:

```bash
cd apps/api && pytest -q
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd apps/web && npm run check && npm run test:auth-routes && npm run build
```

Docker config:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=dummy-validation-secret APP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=dummy docker compose config --quiet
```
